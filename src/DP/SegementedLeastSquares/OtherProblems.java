    //In order to make a large text more readable, we can divide it into several paragraphs.
    // Given is a table that contains a score pi,j (i≤j) for the paragraph that contains sentences
    // i through sentence j. De total score for the division of a text into paragraphs is the
    // sum of the score of all the paragraphs. Which of the following recursive formulas gives
    // an efficient way to calculate the maximum total score using dynamic programming?

    //Given a series of observations (t1,x1), … , (tn,xn) in time, wherein t1 < … < ti … < tn.
    // We want to partition these observations into subsequent intervals of observations which
    // are similar. The costs for placing observations i till j in an interval is given by ci,j.
    // These costs will be bigger if the observations differ more from each other. We define C as
    // the costs for introducing an extra interval. Which of the following formulas for OPT represents
    // correctly the minimal costs of a partitioning of observations in intervals?
